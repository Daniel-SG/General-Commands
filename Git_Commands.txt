//Fast-fordward -> When you merge your branch with master and we haven't done any additional work in master before doing the merge
//Rebase -> move changes done in master to a branch created before that changes were done, (1. checkout other branch, and git rebase master would move the changes to the other branch)

git -> show all option
git init -> Starts an empty repository

git log -> historic of commits (git log --all --graph --decorate --oneline)
git log --oneline -S Alice -> contains the commits that have "Alice" in the commit message
git log 61966bf.. chapter1.txt -> shows the commits after that one related to chapter1.txt file
git log --grep -i 'big changes' commits that contains 'big changes' phrase in the commit message (-i case insensitively)

git checkout commit_id -> Retrieves the files from that commit_id
git checkout -f master -> Same as git checkout but overwriting the files that had been modified
git checkout . -> reeplaces all from the working directory with files from the last commit

git branch -a -> List all branches
git branch -m oldnamebranch newnamebranch -> Rename a Branch
git branch -d branchName -> delete the branch

git merge anotherBranch -m"commit message" -> being in master we can run this command to take changes from anotherBranch merge them and make a commit

git pull -> git fetch + git merge

git push origin master //origin is the copy of our repository 

git clone --shallow -> Copies the most recent version from the repo without the history

git mv oldfilename newfilename

git clean-> Eliminate from the working directory any ??unversioned files
git clean -d -n -> deletes the untracked files, with -d and -n it makes a dry run to show you what would delete
git clean -i -> you can specify which unstaged files delete 

git add -p fileName.txt -> Selecting "s" it allows you choosing which changes add
git add -A -> see changes when files have been renamed or deleted and add them in the staging area

git stash -> caches the files and put back the original files based on the last commit, if there are new files, they are NOT added
git stash -u -> Adds the new files in the cache area
git stash pop -> Put back the files that were in the cache area
git stash newbranch -> 1. creates "newbranch" branch 2. moves the files stashed to the new branch
git stash list -> shows the stashed files 
git stash clear -> empty the list of stashes

git commit --verbose to see the changes you are committing in your editor
git commit -am  -- git add. + git commit -m in one single command (does not add new files)

git show c7d5d6876 gives you the detail of a commitgit log --oneline shows only the first line of the commit message 
git show e420911~1 gives us the parent commit from e420911
git show :/Second as before but with commit message

git tag myTag --> Adds a tag in the current branch, ypu can see the tag running git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
git tag --list --> show all tags
git tag --delete myTag --> delete myTag tag


git diff -> compare changes between the working directory and the staging area
git diff -- filename.txt compare changes between the working directory and the staging area for filename.txt file
git diff --staged HEAD -> Compares the changes between the staging area and the last commit
git diff 8062da0  c79b2d29d -> compares two commits

git ls-files -> shows all files tracked by git

git blame filename -> tell us which person, and more importantly which commit, is to blame for the currentstate of each line in the file 

git grep Alice 3ba3f98~1 -> commits of files that contain Alice and are before that commit

git revert 3ba3f98 -> reviert that commit and clear the working directory

git reset -> it is the opposite operation as git add (delete from stage)
git reset commitid -> will clear the index, and roll the repository back to that revision, as if the subsequent commits had never happened. It won’t change the                         working directory, so the current state of our files won’tbe lost, but the history of how we got to that state will be
git reset --soft HEAD^ -> This has the effect of undoing the commit, taking us back to just before we made it. Note it leaves our changes staged in the index.
git reset --hard -> clear the index and change the working directory

git config --global alias.sla 'log --oneline --decorate --graph --all' -> to add an alias,git sla = git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all

git commit --amend --no-edit -> allows you to add new files in the previous commit (--no-edit, you don't have to specify a new commit message)
