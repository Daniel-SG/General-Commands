Amazon Redshift
Fully managed, petabyte scale data warehouse

• 10X better performance than other DW’s
• Via machine learning, massively parallel query execution, columnar storage
• Designed for OLAP, not OLTP
• Cost effective
• SQL, ODBC, JDBC interfaces
• Scale up or down on demand
• Built in replication & backups
• Monitoring via CloudWatch / CloudTrail
• There is the leader node and the compute node divided by slices
• Massively Parallel Processing (MPP)
• Columnar Data Storage
• Column Compression

Redshift Use Cases
• Accelerate analytics workloads
• Unified data warehouse & data lake
• Data warehouse modernization
• Analyze global sales data
• Store historical stock trade data
• Analyze ad impressions & clicks
• Aggregate gaming data
• Analyze social trends

Redshift Spectrum
• Query exabytes of unstructured data in S3 without loading
• Limitless concurrency
• Horizontal scaling
• Separate storage & compute resources
• Wide variety of data formats
• Support of Gzip and Snappy compression

Redshift Durability
• Replication within cluster
• Backup to S3
• Asynchronously replicated to another region
• Automated snapshots
• Failed drives / nodes automatically replaced
• However limited to a single availability zone (AZ)

Scaling Redshift
• Vertical and horizontal scaling on demand
• During scaling:
  • A new cluster is created while yourold one remains available forreads
  • CNAME is flipped to new cluster(a few minutes of downtime)
  • Data moved in parallel to new compute nodes
  
  
Redshift Distribution Styles
• AUTO -> Redshift figures it out based on size of data
• EVEN -> Rows distributed across slices in round robin
• KEY -> Rows distributed based on one column
• ALL -> Entire table is copied to every node
