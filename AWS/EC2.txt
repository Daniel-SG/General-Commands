EC2 
 - Instance of a virtual machines in AWS
 - In the security groups you can define inbound and outbound traffic
 - Elastic IP allows to keep the same public IP even you you stop and start your EC2 instance
 - If you want to launch an script when starting the instance, you have to add it in the "Advanced Detais -> User Data" when configuring the instance
 - EC2 Hibernate 
 	- only for On Demand and Reserved Instances
 	- Max hibernation of 60 days
 	- Instance RAM size les 150 GB
 	- Not all instances are avaiable to Hibernate (only C,R,M)
 	- it is found in Configure Instance under the name Stop Hibernate behaviour, select the checkbox

Types of EC2
	 On demand: Pay for what you use
	  - They are the most expesive
	  - Recommended for short terms and interrupted workloads

	Reserved instances
	 - from 1 to 3 years
	 - payment upfront
	 - 75% discount compared to On demand
	 - There are other subtypes like..
	 	- Convertible Reserved instance: Can change the EC2 instance type, up to 54% discount
	 	- Scheduled Reserved instance: Launch within the time window you reseve (1 hour a day, from 15:00 to 18:00 etc)

	Spot Instances
		- 90% discount
		- You can lose the instance at any time if your max price is less than the current spot price
		- Useful for jobs that can be rerun (batch process, image rendering...)
		- If your spot is claimed you can block it from 1 to 6 hours
		- If you cancel a spot request, the spot instance is not cancelled, you have to do it manually
		Spot Fleets
			- Define possible launch pools and launch the one that fits better according the strategy choosen (lowestPrice,diversified,capacityOptimized)

	Dedicated Host
		- Physical dedicated host for your use (not shared)
		- Full control for EC2 instance
		- 3 years contract
		- More expensive
		- Useful to bring your own licensed software

	Dedicated Instance
		- Instances running hardware that is dedicated to you
		- May share the hardware with other accounts but only your accounts
		- No control over instance placement

	There are as well other types of Instances:
		- R apps that need a lot of RAM
		- C apps that need good CPU (databases,computational things)
		- M Medium approach between Ram and CPU (general,Webs)
		- I Apps that need good I/O (databases)
		- G Apps that need good GPU (Video rendering, machine learning)

		T2/T3 bustable instances (up to capacity, use credits)
		T2/T3 unlimeted burst

Placements groups
- You can define how your EC2 instances will be set respect the rest of your AWS environment or respect other EC2 instances
- There are 3 strategies
	- Cluster: All instances in the same rack (and availability zone) 
			- Pros: Low latency, high speed netowrk
			- Cons: If the rack fails, all instances fail at the same time
			- Use case: Bigdata jobs, apps that need high speed network

	- Spread: Every EC2 instance will be in a different hardware
			- Pro: Across different availability zones,EC2 instances in a different hardware
			- Cons: Limited to 7 instances per availability zone
			- Use case: Apps where max availability is needed and when every instance must be independent from each other

	- Partition: 
			- Up to 7 partitions per availability zone, in every partition you can add many EC2 instances
			- Up to 100 EC2 instances
			- Partition are in a different racks
			- Use case: HDFS, cassandra, Kafka, HBASE
