AMIs (Amazon Machine Image)
- There are many pre-built and you can create your own Image
- Your own Image can only work in your specific AWS Region by default, although can be changed
- You can use AMI's other people, even rent them per hour
- They are found in Amazon Market Place
- May content malware!
- They live in S3
- The same AMIID cannot be used in other regions
You can share an AMI with another AWS account.
- Sharing an AMI does not affect the ownership of the AMI.
- If you copy an AMI that has been shared with your account, you are the owner of the target AMI in
your account.
- To copy an AMI that was shared with you from another account, the owner of the source AMI must
grant you read permissions for the storage that backs the AMI, either the associated EBS snapshot
(for an Amazon EBS-backed AMI) or an associated S3 bucket (for an instance store-backed AMI).
- Limits:
	• You can't copy an encrypted AMI that was shared with you from another account. Instead, if the
		underlying snapshot and encryption key were shared with you, you can copy the snapshot while reencrypting
		int with a key of your own. You own the copied snapshot, and can register it as a new AMI.

	• You can't copy an AMI with an associated billingProduct code that was shared with you from another
	account. This includes Windows AMIs and AMIs from the AWS Marketplace. To copy a shared AMI
	with a billingProduct code, launch an EC2 instance in your account using the shared AMI and then
	create an AMI from the instance.
