S3
- buckets are defined at a region level
- must start with lower case or number
- must use multipart upload if file bigger than 5gb
- you can version the files uploaded and when you delete them, they are marked as deleted but the files are there

S3 Encryption (4 types)
	- SSE-S3 Encryption using keys handled and managed by AWS, encryption server side
		uses AES-256 encryption
		you must set the header "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256"
	- SSE-KMS: Encryption using keys handled and managed by KMS
		you must set the header "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"aws:kms" and have control over
		the rotation policy
	- SSE-C: server-side encryptopn using keys fully managed bu the customer
		AWS makes the encryption but does not store the file
		HTTPS must be used when sending the file and the key
	- Client Side Encryption
		Client library such Amazon S3 Encruption CLient must be used
		Client must encrypt data before sending and decrypt when receiveing
		Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle
	-Other: HTTPS enpoint is called encryption in flight and encrytion in flight is also called SSL/TLS

S3 Security

 Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to

S3 CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
- It is used to share data with other S3 bucket
- you can limit the amount of data shared

S3 Consistency Model
- Read after consistency PUTS of new objects
	* as soon as an object is written we can retrieve it
	* execpt if we did a get before to see if the object existed, then it takes a while
- Eventual consustency for DELETES and PUTS of existing objects
    * if we read an object after updating we might get the old version
    *  if we delete an object we might still be able to retrieve it for a short time
