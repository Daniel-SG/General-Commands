Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
 - Represents a virtual network card
 - You can have several private IPs for the same EC2 instance
 - One or more security groups
 - They are attached to a specific AZ
 - They can be moved easily from one EC2 instance to another

Load Balancers
-There are 3 types
 1. Classic load balancer, supports HTTP,HTTPS,TCP.(X-Z, disabled by default and free of charge if used)support only one SSL certificate
 2. Application Load Balancer, supports HTTP HTTPS WebSocket (X-Z, Enabled by default and free of charge if used) support several SSL certificates at the same time
 	- the instances are divided in target groups
 3. Network Load Balancer TCP,TLS, UDP (X-Z, disabled by default and Charge if used)uses SNI
 	- is very fast, low latency
 	- has one static IP per AZ

 - Load Balancers can be internal (may be accessed from outside) or internal
 -Troubleshooting:
 	- 4xx errors at client side
 	- 5xx errors at application side
 	- 503 means capacity or application not registered yet
 	- all access per request are accesible in the logs

 - Stickyness is used to keep the user always going to the same ec2 instance
	it may produce overload (EC2->Target Group->yourTG->Edit attributes) 
- Cross Zone(X-Z) Load Balancing distributes evenly across all instances of AZ, if not activated
	the request goes inside the same AZ
- SSL/TLS certificates provide data encription from the client to the load balancer
- SNI solves the problem of loading multiples SSL certificates onto one web server. Does not work for CLB (classic LB)
- Connection Draining or Registration Delay is the time to complete request while the instance is unhealthy or deregistered
- Provide a single point of access for you application DNS (not IP) 

Auto Scaling Group ASG
- Scale-in or Scale-out EC2 instances according to certain criteria
- You define min and max capacity and the alarms (in CloudWatch) to trigger the scale-in/out
- The alarms can be CPU,memory usage or own defined metrics
- You can schedule scale-in/out at some specific time
- You cooldown let you add some time before scale-in/out is triggered
- lifecicle hook is the availability to make some preparations before scaling in/out
